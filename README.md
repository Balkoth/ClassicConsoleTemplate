# Welcome to the ClassicConsoleTemplate repository
This project aims to bring back the classic C# console template that Microsoft changed in .NET6 to the new style.

## Clarifications
The initial commit of this repository contains the template as it is delivered to you in the .NET SDK 6.0.8 release.

In the following commits attempts are made to bring back the template as it was in earlier versions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, especially for the language files, as i just ran the english version through Google Translate.
